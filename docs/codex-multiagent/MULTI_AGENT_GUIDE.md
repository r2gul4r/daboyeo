# Multi-Agent Operating Guide

This document explains why the template is shaped the way it is.

The core idea is simple:
reduce collisions first, then add delegation only when the task actually needs it.

## 1. Why The Default Is `single-session`

- Most confusion comes from splitting too early, not from having too few roles.
- Parallel work gets expensive fast while shared contracts are still moving.
- On small tasks, handoff cost is often larger than implementation cost.
- Single-session execution can look slower while still producing a shorter total lead time.

## 2. Hard Trigger + Scorecard Gate

Use task-size gating before deciding whether `main` should write directly or switch into a delegated profile.

Hard triggers first:

- Shared contract changes
- Shared asset changes
- Multi-layer changes
- Naturally separable write sets
- A contract shift from sample/demo output to real data integration
- Read-heavy collection or normalization that can run independently from downstream rendering
- Contract instability that can change API, schema, props, payload, env keys, or normalized data shape
- High investigation uncertainty where implementation depends on facts not yet discovered
- Data fidelity risk, especially when real-world data, coordinates, metrics, or external sources must be trusted
- External source dependency that must be checked before implementation can be correct
- Implementation depending on discovery results that may change the planned write sets
- Ambiguous acceptance criteria that can change the contract or verification target
- Medium-or-higher regression risk
- A clearly necessary reviewer pass

If any hard trigger exists, reclassify before implementation writes.
Hard triggers are gates, not hidden score boosts and not delegation orders; record the trigger by name, then decide topology from contract stability, write-set separability, verification independence, `orchestration_value`, handoff cost, and `agent_budget`.

Do not score only from the final edited file count.
One rendered HTML or frontend file can still hide separate upstream responsibilities such as data collection, coordinate extraction, normalization, or schema confirmation.

If no hard trigger exists, score these at `1` point each:

- `3+` modified files
- `2+` directories
- `2+` new files
- test changes required
- meaningful code reading required before editing
- at least one design decision required before implementation
- `2+` verification steps

Profile selection:

- `single-session`
  - default profile
  - usually `0-3` points
  - `main` may edit directly in one tight slice
  - use this only when upstream investigation and downstream implementation are not independently ownable
  - allowed only when the contract is stable, no independent discovery slice exists, verification is small, and the reason is more specific than "one final file"
- `delegated-serial`
  - larger or dependent work where handoff lowers risk
  - `main` coordinates workers one slice at a time
  - good fit when collection or normalization must finish before rendering, but each slice is still independently verifiable
  - choose this when dependencies exist between slices or the contract must be frozen after discovery
- `delegated-parallel`
  - strong candidate at `7+` points when the parallel gate passes
  - `main` delegates safe slices to workers
  - good fit when collection, normalization, and rendering can proceed with pinned contracts and separate ownership
  - allowed only when the contract is frozen, write sets are disjoint, shared assets have one owner, `main` will not write during the parallel phase, and slice verification exists
- `mixed`
  - uneven tasks that need both sequential and parallel delegation
  - choose this when one phase must run serially to freeze the contract and later phases can fan out safely

Efficiency gate:

- Keep three gates separate:
  - `score_total` is a complexity/risk prior.
  - `evaluation_need` is the close-out evidence depth: `none`, `light`, or `full`.
  - `orchestration_value` is the delegation value: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.
- `0-3` points usually stays local unless there is a clean reviewer or explorer sidecar with almost no handoff cost.
- `4-6` points use a lightweight spawn/no-spawn basis when the choice is non-obvious. Spawn only when a role can return useful work while `main` continues non-overlapping work, or when serial delegation lowers risk enough to justify the handoff.
- `7+` points must record an explicit `spawn_decision` unless a concrete blocker keeps the work local. A blocker can be one blocking discovery result, one tightly coupled edit surface, unclear ownership, weak verification independence, or handoff cost higher than expected gain.
- `10+` points still split evaluation and orchestration: require a concrete evaluation plan, then choose `single-session`, `delegated-serial`, `delegated-parallel`, or `mixed` from ownership clarity and handoff value.

Do not write "efficiency" as vague optimism. Ground the decision in:

- handoff cost
- ownership clarity
- discovery separability
- verification independence
- rework risk

Record `efficiency_basis` in `STATE.md` before spawning. Use a one-line basis only when a `4-6` point choice is genuinely non-obvious; use the fuller structure below for delegated profiles or policy/template changes:

- `parallelizable_slices`: the independent slices and their owners
- `handoff_cost`: why the handoff is small enough
- `expected_gain`: wall-clock reduction, lower risk, or better review coverage
- `blocking_dependencies`: anything that prevents immediate fan-out
- `spawn_decision`: `spawn`, `defer_until_contract_freeze`, or `do_not_spawn`

Using the kit grants task-scoped standing authorization for subagent delegation only, but the call is still an AI decision. Spawn without asking only when no higher-priority policy blocks the call and all of these are true:

- the slice has a read-only scope or a disjoint write set
- the output can be verified independently
- `agent_budget` is greater than `0`
- `main` will not write the same files during a parallel phase
- the expected gain is larger than handoff and wait cost

When a higher-priority system, host, runtime, or tool policy blocks a useful spawn, stay in `single-session` until the user grants explicit task-scoped approval. Ask only when delegation would materially unblock the task or lower risk, and name the proposed role, slice, expected gain, ownership scope, and verification target.

Do not spawn just because the score is high, and do not ask for approval on every task. High score starts the efficiency analysis; safe ownership, useful parallel work, host policy, and task value decide the actual call.

Recursive Socratic improvement gate:

- Treat recursive improvement as two scoped loops: task-local bounded repair for the current workspace task, and global-kit rule evolution for kit-level policy or template changes.
- Task-local recursive improvement does not create a new objective; it stays inside the current task's pinned write set, tests, docs, and verification surface.
- Trigger the global-kit rule evolution gate for policy, workflow, delegation, installer/template, global default, permission language, or new recording-field changes; also trigger it when the user asks whether a design is too heavy.
- Keep global-kit rule evolution proposal-only unless the user explicitly asks for kit-level implementation.
- Use the smallest useful loop: `4-6` points gets three questions, `7+` gets an efficiency-and-safety pass, and installer/template/global-default text gets the blast-radius pass.
- Keep the output fixed: failure mode, direct or indirect effect, blast radius, verdict `keep`/`soften`/`remove`, minimal edit, self-check, and final recommendation.
- For installer, template, global default, or authorization wording, ask: "Does this describe existing authority, or create authority the user did not grant?"
- Finish with the adversarial pass: did the simplification become too weak, too vague, or likely to revive the original failure mode?
- This is not a background autonomous optimizer. Do not add polling, daemonized self-editing, cross-workspace learning, or unrelated repository auto-edits.

Blast-radius tiers:

- `task-local auto`: may patch the current task's local wording or workflow notes.
- `workspace-local guarded`: may patch workspace rules only after the scope is pinned in `STATE.md`.
- `global-kit proposal-only`: propose global installer/default changes unless the user explicitly asked for the kit patch.
- `never-auto`: authority wording, security-sensitive defaults, destructive command policy, and permission semantics require explicit user intent before implementation.

Before any write begins:

- record the exact `orchestration_profile` and concrete `reason` in `STATE.md`
- record `score_total`, `score_breakdown`, `hard_triggers`, `selected_rules`, `selected_skills`, `execution_topology`, `orchestration_value`, and `agent_budget`; record `efficiency_basis` and `spawn_decision` when delegation efficiency is being evaluated
- report to the user which score or trigger basis was read from `STATE.md` and how that changes the startup plan, such as staying local, starting serial delegation, or opening parallel worker lanes
- do not use legacy route labels or hedge labels such as `single-agent fallback`
- on `single-session`, keep one write-capable lane and no subagent calls
- if the user changes the contract mid-task, record whether the old `single-session` reason still holds; if not, reclassify before continuing
- if the current phase is review or design, stay read-only: patch text may be proposed, but files and write-capable delegation wait until patch scope is pinned and implementation is explicitly entered
- on delegated profiles, `main` delegates implementation to workers and keeps ownership boundaries explicit
- on delegated profiles, a `reviewer` pass is mandatory when `review_required` is selected
- on delegated profiles, if shared assets and feature files are both touched, use `worker_shared` plus at least one feature worker

Decision gate:

- If `delegated-parallel` fails any required condition, do not use parallel delegation. Choose `delegated-serial` only when the serial handoff still lowers risk; otherwise stay `single-session` or run discovery first.
- If `single-session` has a vague reason such as "small task" or "one file", stop and replace it with a concrete ownership and verification reason.
- If implementation correctness depends on facts that are not yet known, use explorer-first discovery before implementation.

Start decision tree:

1. Did a hard trigger fire?
2. If yes, does correctness depend on facts not yet known?
3. If yes, start in explorer-first discovery.
4. If no, are the contract and write sets already pinned and disjoint?
5. If yes, choose `delegated-parallel` only when the full parallel gate passes; otherwise choose `delegated-serial` or stay `single-session` with a concrete blocker.
6. If no hard trigger fired, score the task.
7. `0-3` points stays `single-session` only when no independent upstream slice exists.
8. `4-6` points stays a judgment call; record a lightweight spawn/no-spawn basis only when the choice is non-obvious.
9. `7+` points records `spawn_decision`; choose `delegated-parallel` only if the parallel gate passes, otherwise choose `delegated-serial` or stay `single-session` with a concrete blocker.
10. If one early phase must freeze the contract and a later phase can fan out, choose `mixed`.

## 3. What Makes A Safe Slice

A safe slice satisfies all four conditions below:

- The goal can be described in one line.
- The changed file range is small and closed.
- The shared contract is already pinned.
- There is a clear way to verify the result.

For upstream work, the "changed file range" may be a produced dataset, normalization note, or other intermediate artifact responsibility rather than only the final UI file.

If any part is blurry, shrink the slice or keep it in `single-session`.

## 3.1 Explorer-First And Re-Orchestration

Use explorer-first discovery when the task mentions real data, external sources, coordinates, schema inference, broad codebase scouting, unstable acceptance criteria, or any implementation that depends on not-yet-known facts.

Discovery mode rules:

- `phase` is `discovery`
- `writer_slot` is `none` unless updating `STATE.md` or `MULTI_AGENT_LOG.md`
- output is findings, proposed contract, write-set recommendation, verification target, and reclassification recommendation
- implementation waits until `main` records the updated contract and execution topology

If a worker or `main` discovers a new hard trigger, contract mismatch, or write-set conflict during execution, stop and mark the task `contract_blocked` or `reclassify_required`.

Record:

- `trigger_found`
- `discovered_by`
- `impact`
- `required_action`

No implementation writes continue until `main` updates `STATE.md`, refreshes `execution_topology`, and records whether the task stays local, moves serial, moves parallel, or becomes mixed.

## 3.2 Evaluation And Verification Gates

Use `evaluation_need` separately from `execution_topology`:

- `none`: clear acceptance, strong hard checks, and no meaningful reviewer judgment.
- `light`: compact checklist or one reviewer-style pass for non-obvious wording, UX, contract, or regression risk.
- `full`: explicit evaluation plan for ambiguous acceptance, sensitive contracts, weak executable checks, broad regression blast radius, or subtle behavior/wording judgment.

Score bands guide the first pass but do not decide evaluator strength:

- `0-3` with clear acceptance and strong hard checks defaults to no formal evaluator or a tiny checklist.
- `4-6` creates a compact evaluation plan only when acceptance, contracts, or reviewer judgment are non-obvious.
- `7+` requires an evaluation plan, but orchestration remains a separate decision.
- High score alone does not upgrade `evaluation_need`, high score alone does not justify delegation, and file count alone upgrades neither `evaluation_need` nor `orchestration_value`.

Hard checks outrank LLM review. Treat `llm_review_rubric` as a soft second pass, not the source of truth.

Use the selected profile to set the minimum verification gate before close-out:

- `single-session`: code review plus the smallest relevant repository command when available
- `delegated-serial`: verify each slice output, then verify the integrated contract after the final slice
- `delegated-parallel`: verify each worker output, check shared-contract consistency, check write-set ownership, then run final integration verification
- `mixed`: verify the serial contract-freeze phase before fan-out, then apply the parallel gate to the fan-out phase

If no verification target can be named, do not fan out; return to discovery or shrink the slice.

## 3.3 Review And Design Mode Latch

Review and design modes are read-only.
They may produce findings, diagrams, patch text, or a proposed implementation scope.

They may not:

- edit repository files
- spawn write-capable workers
- treat accepted design feedback as implementation permission

Move into implementation only after `main` records the patch scope, write sets, and verification target in `STATE.md`.

## 4. Native Spec-First Gates

The kit does not bundle workflow skills for spec-first phases. Spec-first behavior is native to `AGENTS.md`, `STATE.md`, and the selected orchestration profile.

- Clarify requirements in a read-only phase when scope is unclear or still moving.
- Freeze the contract by recording scope, write sets, verification targets, and non-goals in `STATE.md`.
- Enter implementation through the selected orchestration profile once the contract is stable enough.
- Verify against the frozen contract using repository checks and record the result in `STATE.md`.

The user can still override the default picker with natural language. That override wins.

## 5. When To Use `explorer`

`explorer` only matters when scouting is cheaper than guessing.

- Files are spread across a wide area.
- Existing contracts need to be confirmed before editing.
- Test scope needs to be narrowed first.
- Discovery cost is higher than implementation cost.

If the file and the edit are obvious, splitting out an explorer is just ceremony.

## 6. When Multiple Agents Are Actually Safe

Parallel work is reasonable only when all of these are true:

- `main` is not writing during the parallel phase
- Shared contracts such as API, schema, or payload are already pinned
- Shared assets have one clear owner
- Verification can also stay separate
- `main` already knows the integration point
- `agent_budget` is large enough to cover the parallel slices

There are no fixed role caps anymore. The task budget decides.

Recommended topology examples:

- `worker_feature_1`
- `worker_feature_2`
- `worker_feature_3`
- `worker_shared`

Good example:

- `main` freezes payload shape, state names, and write sets
- `worker_shared` updates common types and shared helpers
- feature workers edit separate feature directories
- reviewer checks contracts, regressions, and scope ownership at the end

Bad example:

- `worker_feature_1` edits a shared type file
- `worker_feature_2` edits the same shared type file differently
- `main` keeps writing while both workers are active
- This creates contract drift even when the changed feature files are separate

## 7. What Every Handoff Should Include

The more roles you split across, the more the input contract matters.

Recommended handoff format:

```md
Goal
- One-line acceptance criteria

Edit scope
- Files or directories

Pinned contracts
- APIs, schemas, routes, events, or env keys that must not drift

Selection
- `selected_rules`, `selected_skills`, `execution_topology`, `orchestration_value`, `agent_budget`

Verification
- Commands

Done means
- What the reviewer should be able to confirm at the end
```

## 8. Lightweight Task Board Beats A Heavy Queue

For this kit, a full runtime queue is overkill.
But a lightweight task board is worth it.

Use `STATE.md` to track:

- `current_task`
- `next_tasks`
- `blocked_tasks`
- `orchestration_profile`
- `writer_slot`
- `contract_freeze`
- `write_sets`
- `selected_rules`
- `selected_skills`
- `execution_topology`
- `orchestration_value`
- `agent_budget`
- `evaluation_need`
- `project_invariants`
- `task_acceptance`
- `non_goals`
- `hard_checks`
- `llm_review_rubric`
- `evidence_required`
- `reviewer_target` when a reviewer is assigned

That gives `main` enough structure to sequence work without pretending this repo is a full scheduler.

Default mode is still one shared task board.
Do not introduce concurrent thread-local state just because the task is large.

Use concurrent registry mode only when multiple live threads must work in the same workspace at the same time and the write ownership can actually stay disjoint.

In that mode:

- root `STATE.md` becomes the registry
- record `state_mode = concurrent-registry`
- track `active_threads`
- track `workspace_locks`
- track shared-contract notes that apply across threads
- move each live execution lane into `states/STATE.<thread_id>.md`
- keep the core sections unchanged inside each thread state file

If two live threads need the same file, the same shared asset, or the same contract surface, concurrent mode is the wrong fix.
Serialize the work or move one slice into a separate worktree.

## 9. Why Explicit Profiles And Write Sets Help

Small and large tasks need different visibility.

Recommended values:

- `orchestration_profile = single-session | delegated-serial | delegated-parallel | mixed`
- `reason = hard trigger name | concrete score summary`
- `writer_slot = free | main | worker_name | parallel`
- `write_sets = [worker_name = file globs]`
- `reviewer_target = reviewer | reviewer_name`
- `agent_budget = task-scoped budget`

Before delegated execution starts:

- freeze the contract
- declare write-set ownership
- name the shared-assets owner
- name the reviewer target

After delegated execution ends:

- collapse back to `writer_slot = free`
- keep the handoff evidence in `MULTI_AGENT_LOG.md`

That makes accidental ownership drift much harder to hide.

## 10. Why Contract Freeze Should Be Explicit

The most common multi-agent breakage is contract drift.

- API shapes change
- props change
- schema changes
- env keys change

So `main` should mark `contract_freeze` before handing off the writer slot.

## 11. What `reviewer` Should Actually Look For

`reviewer` is not there to finish the implementation.
It is the last risk filter.

Recommended priority order:

1. Contract violations
2. Regression risk
3. Missing tests or verification
4. Write-set or shared-asset ownership violations
5. Minor style issues

Style comes last.
If the structure is broken, formatting comments are noise.

## 12. What To Do When A Worker Gets Stuck

- Do not respawn the same worker with the same prompt.
- Check whether the problem is an unclear contract or an oversized slice.
- If the contract is unclear, let `main` pin it again.
- If the slice is too large, cut it in half.
- If the slice crosses shared assets, move that part to `worker_shared`.
- If discovery was too thin, add a short `explorer` pass.
- If the budget is exhausted, repair inside the remaining `agent_budget` or reclassify the task.

## 13. What To Customize Per Repository

- Real verification commands
- Generated folders or risky paths that should not be edited
- Shared contract lists
- Manual approval zones such as deploys, migrations, or external writes
- Domain worker names
- Skill-selection overrides for repository-specific workflows
- Whether concurrent registry mode is enabled and where thread state files live
- Where task retrospectives should be appended

## 14. Retrospectives And Rule Evolution

A task board helps you not crash during execution.
A retrospective helps you not repeat the same crash next week.

After non-trivial work, especially anything involving reclassification, collisions, installer surprises, or verification gaps, capture a compact note with:

- task name
- `score_total`
- `evaluation_fit`: `under`, `fit`, or `over`
- `orchestration_fit`: `under`, `fit`, or `over`
- predicted topology or selected profile
- actual topology used
- `spawn_count`
- rework or reclassification
- reviewer findings
- verification outcome
- `next_gate_adjustment`: optional one-liner for future evaluation/orchestration calibration

Do not introduce a separate standing rule-evolution artifact.
Reuse task retrospectives as evidence; repeated patterns may support future AGENTS or installer proposals.

## 15. Recommended Adoption Order

1. Start with `main`
2. Add hard-trigger + scorecard gating
3. Add `STATE.md` once tasks stop fitting in your head
4. Add repository-specific skill routing only when a real workflow needs it
5. Add `agent_budget` once delegation starts to spread across multiple slices
6. Add `worker_shared` when common types, shared utils, or common components keep causing collisions
7. When real collisions appear, add repository-specific forbidden patterns
8. Only after real same-workspace collisions appear, add concurrent registry mode
9. Once execution patterns repeat, add compact retrospectives and use them as evidence for kit-level proposals

## 16. One-Line Summary

Multi-agent work is not a free productivity buff.
It is distributed coordination with extra failure modes.

Gate task size first.
Pin contracts early.
Use reviewer as the last firewall.
